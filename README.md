# Machine Learning
The following repository contains machine learning algorithms written from scratch. The list includes

- Regression algorithms
  - Normal Gradient Descent
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent
  - Autograd versions
  - LASSO
  - Ridge regression
- Logistic regression
- naive bayes algorithms
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
- K - nearest neighbors
- Neural Networks
  - Dense layers only
- Support Vector Machines
  - soft margin
  - hard margin
- Decision Trees and Random Forests

In order to use the following repository, simply clone it and install the mecessary dependencies present in the `requirements3.txt` file. 

Most algorithms are not optimised for runtime, however is a part of the future scope of this project.
